# City-Trip-Weather-Forecast


## My eighth challenge with the edX Bootcamp

I completed this task for the eighth challenge in the edX Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. I was tasked with creating code for a weather forecast app for a city of the user's choosing. I was provided with HTML starter code and then needed to write Javascript and CSS code.  This task aimed to use the JavaScript and jQuery skills I had learned during the week. I used fetch() to use the server API OpenWeather to find a 5 day forecast.  I used jQuery syntax to find and create HTML elements and also used dayjs() to display the date for each forecast day. 

## Usage
The user needs to type in a city of their choosing into the search bar and then click on the search button. Then the day's forecast should appear along with a 5 day forecast for that city. If the user would like to look at the forecast for a previous search result they can click on the buttons underneath the search bar to see that city's forecast displayed again.

## Acknowledgements

I used Chat GPT and Xpert Learning Assistant to help me troubleshoot. In particular, I used code from Xpert Learning Assistant to create two fetch calls so I could get the Latitude and Longitude of a city and then use this information to get the weather data for a particular city. I also used chat GPT to help me find how to display icons on my webpage.
